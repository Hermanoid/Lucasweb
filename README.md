# Lucasweb
The lucasweb:  A combination of epic coding fails.

***

As the name suggests, this is all of my website-coding fails in one place.  It will all be made in the MVC Framework, and anything that isn't will be converted.  Anything that can't be converted will be linked.  Either way, It's all here.

***

This is a project, and it's a personal project.  Therefore there will be minimal documentation if any.  You may also notice, if you decide to look through all this, that it is all done quite crappily.  yeah.  That's my skilz.

_Note:  This stuff is open for the public eye, and anyone willing to examine the horridness of my code can do so.  I release this stuff to be read pubically and hereby allow anyone using for their own purposes (unless otherwise stated).  However, if you want to make professonal, not crappy code, this probably wouldn't be a very good source.  And, the older the code, the younger and less professonal the kid making it._

_Note again:  Yes, you did just read the end of that note.  At the time of writing this README, I am 13 years old.  So.  Crappy code._
