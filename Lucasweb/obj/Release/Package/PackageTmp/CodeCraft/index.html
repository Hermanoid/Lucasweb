        <p class="lead">CodeCraft_Masters is a nice Web Development Class in Omaha, NE that I happen to attend.  Starting at week 6, all projects from that class will be hosted.  Here.</p>
        <p>You can see all the available straight-html websites created in the class below.  Keep in mind that, following a certain date that isn't set,  all projects will be done in advanced formats not available here.  Those projects, however, will still be linked below.  Those links will just deport you to another country, maybe Mexico. Or Cuba.  A lot of people get deported back to there.</p>
